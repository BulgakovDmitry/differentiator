## üöÄ Quick Start
To build the project:
```cpp
git clone https://github.com/BulgakovDmitry/differentiator
cd differentiator
make run
./diff.out
```
The project has a function for graphical output of a binary tree. For this purpose graphviz is used. Download it on linux at the following script:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install graphviz
```
It is also possible to output the expression in a pdf file for easy reading. The built-in tex is used for this purpose. Script for installation:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install texlive-full
```

## üîç Overview
All mathematical expressions are written in a binary tree. In the general case, visually it looks as follows (fragment from the graphical dump)
